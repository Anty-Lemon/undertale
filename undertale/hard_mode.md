# Undertale - Hard Mode Route

## Records
[speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale#Frisk_Mode)

## Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the Hard Mode route, which requires naming the Fallen Human `Frisk` at the beginning of the game.
- Time begins on "YES" during name select and ends on the last meaningful action (?).

## Tricks and Info
- Race strats - `SAVE`!
- Mashing `Z / ENTER` and `X / SHIFT` allows rapid text though most dialogue.
- Battle notes below will not include `MERCY`: `Spare`. It is assumed unless otherwise stated.
- Holding `UP` and `DOWN` at the same time allows you to "gyrate" against the topmost wall, which is handy for getting through doorways that are on the topmost wall ASAP or hitting switches in Room 5, etc.

## Ruins
Most of this run is handled in the RUINS, so the guide will be a more detailed route through the ruins and details about the enemies and the enemy combinations.

## Encounters
From what I can tell, it seems encounters are determined when you enter the room and it's determined by the number of steps you take. More research can probably be done on this.

## Enemy Combinations
Enemies | `ACT` | Attacks | Notes
:------ | :---- | :------ | :----
Final Froggit | `Compliment` | Flies, Frog Jump | Can sometimes run, but it's inconsistent. Easier to `Compliment`, hold out for an attack, `Spare`.
Final Froggit, Whimsalot | Froggit: `Compliment`, Whimsalot: `Pray` | Flies + Butterflies, Flies + Butterfly Circle | `Pray` guarantees Flies + Butterfly Circle (?) and gives a couple of healables if you're careful.
Final Froggit, Astigmatism | Froggit: `Compliment`, Astigmatism: `Pick On / Don't Pick On`| Flies + Rotating Spheres, Flies + Bouncing Spheres | Be sure to pay attention to what Astigmatism wants you to do after `Compliment`ing Froggit. Using `Challenge` on Astigmatism will also allows you to `Spare` the remaining enemies, but not Astigmatism.
Parsnik | `Snack` | Bouncing Snakes | `Snack` will give you a `1 HP` heal.
Twin Parsniks | `Snack`, `Snack` | Bouncing Snakes | `Snack` will give you a `1 HP` heal.
Twin Moldessas | `Fix`, `Fix` | Falling balls, Falling + exploding balls | You might be able to use `Lie Down` to gain some HP but it's probably not worth it.
Line of Moldessas | `Lie Down`, `Spare`, `Fix` | Falling balls, Falling + exploding balls | Using `Lie Down` will heal `2 HP` and will make the other two bored, which will let you `Spare` them the turn afterwards. If `Fix` is used on a Moldessa being the final enemy, she will not attack at all.

## Beginning
Name the Fallen Human "Frisk".

## Room 0
Walk to the door on the right.

## Room 1
Mash through Flowey as usual. Positioning your SOUL in the top right will allow you to get hit faster, and moving to the bottom left will summon Toriel quicker.

## Room 2
Follow Toriel to the top.

## Room 3
Mash through Toriel's text and follow her.

## Room 4
Use gyration to hit the first two switches on the top wall. Easier movement.

## Room 5
After mashing through Toriel, start the dummy fight. Quickest way out seems to be `ACT`: `Talk`.

## Room 6
Just `Spare` at the Froggit encounter. It's the fastest menuing and Toriel always gives the look of death in this mode for some reason.

## Room 7
Walk all the way to the end (it's okay, Toriel's just behind the pillar). Leave after mashing.

## Room 8
You may have an encounter here before exiting the room.

## Room 9
Fall through a pitfall closer to the upper wall to save a bit of time.

## Room 10
Mash through Toriel, answering whatever for the Pie question.

Push the rock all the way to the right.

By now, there should be an encounter. Exit the room afterwards.

## Room 11
Walk through the pitfall maze. If you fall or misroute, you may have an encounter.

## Room 12
Mash through Rock #4. You will likely have an encounter before pulling him back to the switch.

## Room 13
You may want to `SAVE` if you lost a lot of HP. It does waste time, but you can be the judge.

## Room 14
Fight Napstablook. Nothing really changed in this fight. Just `Cheer` him on!

Head upwards afterwards.

## Room 15
Mash through Toriel when she calls.

## Room 16
Fall through the middle pitfall and hit the switch. Exit to the right.

## Room 17
Head downwards.

## Room 18
Hit the switch behind the pillar to the left of you when you enter the room.

## Room 19
Hit the Red Switch at the top left of the room.

## Room 20
Hit the switch behind the top left pillar. You may get one more encounter here.

## Room 21
Head upwards to Toriel.

## Room 22
Mash through Toriel and head upwards. No need to `SAVE` as she healed you when you entered the room.

## Home
Mash through Toriel more, and then enter your room and sleep on the bed.

Don't pick up the Pie. Just leave the room.

Mash through Toriel, making sure to ask how to leave the RUINS on the final prompt.

Head downstairs, mashing through text towards the Toriel battle.

## Toriel
From what I've been able to see, it's impossible to die here. Getting hands is faster but as soon as you're low health, getting hit once will knock you to `2 HP` and she'll refuse to attack you.

Additionally, killing her is faster than mashing `Spare`.

## Hard Mode
Just mash through it. You're done!
