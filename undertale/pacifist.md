# Undertale - True Pacifist Route

## Records
[speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale#True_Pacifist_Ending)

## Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the True Pacifist route, which requires achieving a Neutral ending at least once during the run.
- Time begins on "YES" during name select and ends on the last text box you go through with Toriel.

-----

## Tricks and info
- Wallhumping: Holding `UP` + `DOWN` while against an upper wall allows you to rapidly swap between facing up and down, which is good for battle hunting.
- Holding `X / SHIFT` while in battle allows your SOUL to move slower.
- SAVE sparingly.
- Rapidly hitting `Z / ENTER` and `X / SHIFT` allows rapid text though most dialogue.
- Battle notes below will not include `MERCY`: `Spare`. It is assumed unless otherwise stated.

## These Notes
- Written from the current [WR by Celestics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYbMA_jgv2M) as linked. 
- (As of writing, time is 1:53:35.)

-----

## Beginning

Name the Fallen Human a one character name.

## Ruins

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Froggit | `Compliment+Spare | Flee` | It is faster to hit the frog than wait for it to leap. 2G for sparing tactic.
Whimsun | `Terrorize+Spare | Flee` | 2G for sparing tactic.
Moldsmal | `Imitate/Flirt+Spare | Spare` | 1G for imitating before sparing. Always faster to Spare than Flee.
Napstablook | `Cheer+Cheer+Cheer+Flirt` | *Really not feelin up to it right now. Sorry.*
Loox | `Flee` |
Vegetoid | `Flee` |
Migosp | `Flee` |

### Flowey
- It's faster to hit the bullets. Run into them into the upper right corner, then into the circle at the bottom left.

### Dummy
- `ACT`: `Talk`

Wallhump for the switches to save time.

Run from the Froggit in the Spike puzzle room.

You will need `7 GOLD` by the time you get to the Spider Bakesale to purchase a Spider Donut. Froggits and Whimsuns give 2G each, Moldsmals give 1G each. Use your imagination.

After being given the CELL, get 2G in the next room.

The room after, Wallhump to force another encounter for 2G.

In the room with the first rock, the Pie question does not matter. Just mash through it. Force an encounter to get 2G.

In the room with the three rocks, go to the bottom of the rock and talk to it twice. Make a roundabout to the back of the rock such that the third time you talk to it you get pushed towards the spikes. Reset the spikes and move back to the right side of the rock; if lucky, you can force an encounter AND also talk to the rock before the `FIGHT` begins. The worst encounter you can possibly get in this room is 2 Froggits since you must take 2 cycles. Otherwise get at least 1G through one turn and then keep moving.

Pick up the `Faded Ribbon` in the last pitfall room (bottom left hole). Fall in the top-middle pitfall to press the switch.

In case you don't remember, the Perspective Rooms (in order):
- Top column
- Red switch
- Leftmost column

## Home
Toriel heals you immediately, so no need to `SAVE`.

Sleep immediately.

Pick up the `Butterscotch Pie`.

When mashing through Toriel's text, listen to the bit on snails first (2 dialogue prompts) and select `How to exit the RUINS` on the third and final prompt.

Enemy | `ACT`
:---- | :----
Toriel | `Spare`

> Hit the hand attacks. These are the fast ones. Ideally you can skip 5 of these.

> Hang around the upper left corner for the other fire vortex attacks. (Avoid them so you can get hands.)

> Getting to `2 HP` will force Toriel to not attack you. This is your 6th possible skip in the fight.

The best time possible for this segment is around 7:40, give or take a few seconds.

## Path to Snowdin

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Snowdrake | `Flee` |
Ice Cap | `Flee` |
Doggo | `Stick+Spare` |
Lesser Dog | `Flee` | 
Married Dogs | `Stick+Spare` |
Greater Dog | `Stick+Spare` | Run into the barking dog to end the attack faster.

`SAVE` here to heal to full.

Pick up the `Tough Glove` from the `Box` and equip it.
- The `Stick` will allow you to bypass all dog-type enemies after using it once and then `SPARE`ing them after.

#### Absolutely NO MOVING!!!

In spite of the sign, moving right, waiting, and then moving left actually ends Doggo's attack by up to .5 seconds faster each turn. Use the `Stick` and then `Spare`. 

Slide on the ice in the next room to avoid getting an encounter.

#### Hey Kid's!

Don't help Ice-E solve the word search.

Answering `Jumble` is three dialogue boxes faster than answering `Crossword`.

#### Warning: Dog Marriage

Dodge the trees and press the hidden switch from the top left. 

Make sure to `Flee` from the Lesser Dog. 

Use the `Stick` on the Dogi and then `Spare`.

#### Flying Papyrus

Hit the switch in the first tree and walk onto the grey button.
- If done correctly, you can press the switch without Papyrus' dialogue triggering. He just floats across the top: http://www.twitch.tv/th3hatt3r/v/21373800
- This is one of the hardest glitches to do reliably so get some practice in.

#### Ice Puzzle

From the Lesser Dog room walk into the ice puzzle room holding UP and RIGHT to hit the first two X's at once and then move RIGHT. The ice sliding puzzle has a specific strategy that saves 1.6 seconds as opposed to simply doing the cinnamon swirl solution. Practice buffering inputs between each slide or it won't work consistently. http://imgur.com/imntI5i 

#### Random Colored Block Puzzle

Say `No` and `Even less` to the questions to skip the puzzle.

#### Is It Really A Snow Poff?

Snow poff... Don't get stuck on it.

Use the `Stick`. If you get the BARK BARK attack from Greater Dog, you can skip it by running into the dog at the bottom. The sleeping dog won't bark until you start moving, mind your i-frames and avoid the BARKs.

## Snowdin Town

Purchase the `Manly Bandanna (50 GOLD)` in the Shop but don't equip it yet. Buy a `Bisicle (15 GOLD)` for Undyne if you want to go to kindergarten.

Take the Underground Tunnel to the other side of town.

### Papyrus
It is faster to let him capture you by losing the fight three times (by 45 seconds!).
- `Check` Papyrus 3 times and run into 5 bones in the first fight. You will start out "blue" in the next two fights, proceed to `Spare` him as normal.

Head back to his home to hang out with him.

Go straight to his room and talk with him.

###Hangout Start!
Mash through the hangout. If he's staring at you, mash C to advance. 

Select his hat. Platonically.

It's faster to not eat the spaghetti, but the menuing is difficult.

## Waterfall

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Aaron | `Flee` | *Who wouldn't?*
Woshua | `Flee` |
Moldsmal | `Spare` |
Shyren | `Flee` |
Temmie | `fLE E!!` |

Pick up the `Old Tutu` in the room after Sans (behind the waterfall).

In the final lilypad room, drop them upwards using the downmost ledge.

### Undyne Spears 1
Dodge the spears??? 

No need for the umbrella. Just wastes time. 

Walk along the top of the next room so Monster Kid has less distance to travel, then walk along the bottom after they start following you.

Wallhumping through castle is faster.

In the next room talk to Monster Kid as soon as possible. It takes just over 4 seconds from the start of the dialogue before they will offer to lift you up. Stand near them and wait for the next dialogue. Walk into them so they can lift you up before mashing through the rest of the text.

### Undyne Spears 2: The Reckoning
You can manipulate these spears by moving all the way up or all the way down in a sort of zig-zag pattern. You can walk through spears after they fully extend. Turn around on the last bridge as soon as the last set of spears begin to fade.

### Dummy!
- Mash `SPARE`.
- Hit it with as much cotton as possible. 
- It's possible to finish the first phase of the fight during the second red dummy attack, although this is difficult.
- Unlike the cotton, which is hit-based, the rockets will always take 4 turns.
- It is NOT faster to get hit by the rockets or the knife. 

`SAVE` here to heal to full. Avoid taking damage between now and Undyne or it will make one the following skips much more difficult. 
- If you're brave, you can skip this `SAVE` for the 2-cycle strat. Just make sure your health works for the Mettaton Quiz skip later.

Purchase the `Cloudy Glasses`.

Memorize the pathing for the Mushroom Room and the Lantern Room. It is possible to avoid the encounter (Temmie) in the Mushroom Room with optimal movement. Temmie will replace the encounter in the next room instead.

Do not help Monster Kid from the bridge. It's faster. (Sorry!)

### Undyne
There are multiple strats for this fight but I'll sort them.

For Kindergarten Strats: https://youtu.be/pRMu_rzQR1A (requires buying the `Bisicle` in Snowdin. Also easier of the two.)

For 2-Cycle Strats: https://youtu.be/HmG9zoRrEGU (Harder of the two but faster.)

##### Kindergarten Strats
- For this you do not need to perform the warp glitch (below) but it's faster for you to do so.
- Intentionally get hit by at least one spear in Undyne's first attack pattern four times. Always block the last spear in any of her attacks as Undyne's turn ends as soon as the last spear disappears. 
- `Challenge` will make the spears move faster for the first four turns, however, the extra time spent menuing is actually the same or even SLOWER than just mashing `Spare`. After Undyne unleashes her "kindergarten" attack the spears will remain at max speed for the rest of the fight, regardless of how many times you used `Challenge`. Continuing to select `Challenge` beyond this point can be up to 7 seconds SLOWER.
- `Flee` ASAP. When using both of these skips Undyne should only catch you twice: once in the second room for the main fight and once in the third room right before Papyrus' phone call. If not timed properly, she will catch you again in the third room.


##### 2-Cycle Strats
- Newer, riskier strat that skips Undyne's 3rd phase (instead of her 2nd) and saves over 40 seconds from the above method. (Credit to Raikou99...?)
- Start off with the glitch warp (below) in the first room to get to the second room without fighting. Fight Undyne in the second room like before but instead block all of her attacks and `Challenge` her for the first four turns, then `Spare`for the last two. Try not to take damage at least until the last turn as Undyne will slow her attacks if you get hit. `Flee` when you turn red and run into the next room.
- Don't move right in the next room until you see the marquee start to scroll (about .25-.5 seconds). If done correctly your character should be almost directly under the left part of the 'W' on the sign when Undyne catches up to you. Alternatively: if you feel confident you can move immediately as long as you stop in the right position.
- Remember to take enough damage during both fights for the Mettaton Quiz Skip. 
- `Challenge` Undyne until you can `Flee` again then move right and mash through the dialogue. If the timng was right, Undyne won't be able to catch up to you before reaching the next screen.

##### Practice this
- Strat to skip the first dialogue and encounter. Simply walk up into the left edge so that the character's left hand is slightly over the border (while facing upward) and move up to the trigger. Once Undyne's dialogue finishes hold down until you reach the room transition (below the black area) and immediately move up. http://webm.host/5d78a/

Be sure to water your Undyne!

## Hotland

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Vulkin | `Flee` |
Tsunderplane | `F-Flee!` |
Pyrope | `Flee` |

Do NOT take the `SAVE`.

Go to the top so when Alphys comes out of the elevator, it saves walking time. Same for after the fight, walk towards the top.

### Mettaton Quiz
- Hit `[A] Money` to skip to the last question and end the battle.
- `[A] Undyne` for the final question is the fastest.

Save after the Lab to heal to full. There's a save point two maps after the lab.

### Lasers Tutorial
Walk along the bottom row at the start of this room to avoid Alphys' phone call explaining laser movement. The saves around 2.50 seconds. (Credit to Wolfiexe)

### Slide Puzzle 1 (Right)
Up, Left, Fire

### Slide Puzzle 2 (Left)
Up, Left, Down, Left, Fire

### Cooking with a Killer Robot
- Walking upwards while the room is dark gets you closer to the food to pick up.
- When placing food, place it leftmost to prevent mashing through to talking with MTT.
- Best time for Human SOUL substitute is 15 seconds on the dot.

Pick up the `Stained Apron` (downward path after going up).

### Conveyor Belt Puzzle
It's possible to trigger the third button before Alphys can call to interrupt you. Doing this glitches the dialogue, loudly, but opens the forcefield. It can save up to 1 second over dialogue mashing but doing this wrong can also crash the game; BE WARNED. https://youtu.be/ocBtQ76tMJo

### Jumping Puzzle
In case you forgot, left, down, down, up down, left, up, up, left.
- Alternatively, there's a glitch you can do that requires you to open the menu the frame after you land on the platform. Watch the bottom of the steam jet that launches you for a visual cue when it begins to fade. http://webm.host/b71a6/
- Consistent setup I found (for me) was mashing CTRL/C as you land onto the platform.

### Royal Guard
- `Clean Armor` for Guard 02. You only need to touch the green part 5 times.
- `Whisper` to Guard 01.
- `SPARE`

### MTT News
- The Script has the fastest dialogue.
- Defuse the bombs. Start with the lower left and arc around the right side to come back to the middle.
- Recommended order: Book > Script > Present > Basketbomb > Dog > Glass
- You can spam Z+ENTER on the Present and Basketbomb to attack them on the instant the fight starts, which will defuse them.
- The best known time is a 61 upon ending the final bomb.

Say `No...` to watching anime with Alphys. Sorta tricky to hit this if you're mashing but it saves time if you take a moment to GUARANTEE you hit it. Anime is garbage tho

Hitting the second laser (downward puzzle) is faster!

### Slide Puzzle 3 (Down)
Left, Up, Left, Left, Right, Fire

### Slide Puzzle 4 (Up)
Left, Right, Fire

### Miss Muffet
Eat the `Spider Donut` for an instant `SPARE`.

Go back and `SAVE`.

Enter the MTT Musical with the first bit of dialogue, quit the game and reload. Cutscene skipped!

### Musical Puzzle
- The map is completable - best time is around 10.
- Route for the maze: http://puu.sh/l8c18/145cbafdcd.png

### Mettaton Fight 2
- Just shoot him once!

## Underground Core

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Madjick | `Talk+Spare` | The `Stick` also works.
Astigmatism | `Flee` | May fail if you don't menu quickly enough.

Blue Blue Orange

Go right when Alphys tells you to go up (you have played the game, right??).

At the save point, go left, up, then left again towards the puzzle.

### Slide Puzzle 5
Take your pick of solutions:
- Up, Right, Up, Left, Left, Down, Left, Fire.
- Up, Up, Left, Down, Left, Down, Left, Fire. (Seemingly least awkward to do)
- Up, Left, Up, Left, Down, Down, Left, Fire.

After the puzzle, go back down to the `SAVE` and to heal to full. Go up and then keep going right until you reach Mettaton's room. Saving at Mettaton wastes time but can be used as a safe strat if you're learning the route.


## Mettaton Kai Ni
- Don't fire first turn. Saves dialogue time.
- Check last turn (boxes with bomb in middle as last attack). Saves time.
- Restarting here is NOT faster, the game files do not save until Death By Glamour begins.

### `OHHHHH YES!`

##### Speechless...?
- You need 12k ratings to finish the battle. You start with 4k.
- Equip the `Faded Ribbon (+1500 > 5500)`.
- Equip the `Manly Bandanna (+1500 > 7000)`
- Equip the `Old Tutu (+1500 > 8500)`.
- Equip the `Cloudy Glasses (+1500 > 10000)`.
- Equip the `Stained Apron (+1500 > 11500)`. Do this last so you don't have to later.
- You will need to gain the remaining 500-ish points by shooting obstacles. The legs are worth only +5 rating but can be shot multiple times very quickly while everything else gives +20. The yellow bullet has an object limit of one so shooting closer to an obstacle will let you shoot again faster. 
- Taking damage gives a violence bonus of +50, +25, +20, +15, and +10 but chances are you won't survive more than three hits.
- If done right, you won't have to hit the essay at all: http://www.twitch.tv/pahchi/v/23842021

##### Pop Quiz!
- If you unfortunately get to the essay, type the bare minimum you need to. The turn ends about 2.50 seconds after you press Z/Enter or stop typing. The shortest time it will allow is about 4 seconds and it can last up to 15 seconds if you keep typing. The essay prompt only checks for specific keywords (strings) or conditions and will only take the one with the highest priority. 
- Typing `legs` gives +350. Typing `toby` gives +300 and has the highest priority (will overwrite any other keyword).


The battle should be over by now.

## New Home
Mash through everything, as slow as it is. Go to the left key first, saves movement time...or does it?

Grab the `Worn Dagger`. (Box on the left)

Equip the `Stained Apron` if you haven't already and the `Worn Dagger`. Drop a piece of armor or use the bandage.

`SAVE` before Judgement.

Once you see the first bit of dialogue with Sans, you can quit the game and reload to spam skip the text.
- Celestics doesn't do this in the WR, probably slower to quit out. Try what you want to.
- It is slower by about 3 seconds to reset over perfect mashing based on a 6 second load time. If you can load faster than 3 seconds then knock yourself out.

`SAVE` before the Asgore fight.

### Asgore
- Eat the Butterscotch Pie to lower his defense.
- The game will start scaling your damage on the 21st turn. The fight should end by the 23rd turn.
- Don't choke.
- Reminder that blue is stand still, orange is move.

`FIGHT` Asgore after the fight, as it is faster.

## My World

### Omega Flowey
It's not possible to die during soul phases, brave the damage to hit each `ACT` faster.
- Phase 1: Knives go the direction `ACT` will be. Head to the top left/right.
- Phase 2: Top left of the room for the `ACT` during the gloves.
- Phase 3: All the way to the right to get to the `ACT`. Don't miss it or you won't catch up to it.
- Phase 4: Above the middle for `ACT`, RNG on whether it appears from the left or right.
- Phase 5: Middle pan for the `ACT`. You can move above the pan for this. (12 waves)
- Phase 6: Stay on the pivot point of the revolver and mash Z/Enter to press the `ACT` sooner. It's the third shot of the eigth wave; don't miss it. Close and reopen the game immediately after the screen flashes and the soul in the monitor changes from yellow to light blue.
- Don't die?????????

`FIGHT` him afterwards, it's faster. Immediately close and restart the game once the first letter pops up from Flowey.

The instant you see UNDERTALE after entering the door, you can close the game and restart to skip the credits.

## Dating Start...?

Head to Waterfall with the Riverman (or the Riverwoman?).

### Undyne Date
Make room in your inventory if you didn't before. 

Select the tea when prompted (furthest right). Mash through everything and hold right to feel the heat. `FIGHT` is faster than `Fake Hit`.

Head to Hotland on the dogboat. Yes, it will always be a dogboat the second time.

Take the letter to Alphys' Lab.

### Alphys Date
Mash through it????

Take the ferry back to Hotland again.

Head to True Lab.

## True Lab

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Memory Head (Sink) | `CELL+Refuse+Spare` |
Endogeny (Dog) | `Stick+Spare` |
Lemon Bread (Save) | `Unhug+Hum+Flex+Spare` |
Amalgamate (Fridge) | `Joke+Joke+Joke` |
Reaper Bird (Mirror) | `Pray+Mystify+Pick On+Spare` | 

Here we are.

Go left first to fight the Sink Amalgamate and grab the key.
- Mash at the first sink instead of turning all three on.
- If you get hit make sure you have full HP before going into the second part of the lab.

Get the key from the bed.

Go downstairs, then right. Fight the Dog Amalgamate, then go left.

Grab the Shower key and head left.

Fight the Save Amalgamate. Head left.

Check the left fridge, and attempt to walk away (to the left). Fight the Fridge Amalgamate.

Grab the Blue Key on the way back to the Bedroom. Insert the Yellow key on the way back as well.

Head right from the Bedroom.

Head right, fight the Mirror Amalgamate.
- For the last phase, if you go behind the body, the heads won't hit you.

Insert the key and head back to the Power Room. Mash through the rest and head back to the elevator.

## The Barrier

Mash through everything. It's a lot of mashing.

No need to heal because the cutscene heals you.

### Asriel Dreemurr
Wait for the music to kick in (rainbow effects), then `Hope` every time. You can buffer the first `Hope` by entering the dialogue and waiting for the music/background transition. Don't die and stuff.

### Asriel Dreemurr Kai Ni
`Struggle` for 4 turns. If you got hit by a diamond in the previous phase, you will start at 1/20 HP. If so, kill yourself on turn 1, survive turns 2 and 3, then kill yourself on turn 4. If you do NOT get hit by the diamond, pray that you don't die at all. Remember - dying the first time loses 10 seconds, but if you would probably die anyways, save yourself the time and kill yourself at the start of the attack.

`SAVE` your friends!
- There's a pre-determined amount of actions for each `SAVE`. So you can use the same `ACT` choice twice.
- If you use the `Pie` while saving Toriel and Asgore, it takes a single action afterward.

Don't comfort Asriel. It's faster.

Mash through The End.

Time ends on the last text box from Toriel, in case you forgot.
