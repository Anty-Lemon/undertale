# Undertale - True Pacifist Route

## Records
[speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/undertale#True_Pacifist_Ending)

## Route Rules
- Start with a 0-reset fresh game. You can do this by deleting the UNDERTALE folder located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local`.
- Complete the True Pacifist route, which requires achieving a Neutral ending at least once during the run.
- Time begins on "YES" during name select and ends on the last text box you go through with Toriel.

-----

## Tricks and info
- Holding `UP` + `DOWN` while against an upper wall allows you to rapidly swap between facing up and down, which is good for battle hunting.
- Holding `X / SHIFT` while in battle allows your SOUL to move slower.
- SAVE sparingly.
- Rapidly hitting `Z / ENTER` and `X / SHIFT` allows rapid text though most dialogue.
- Battle notes below will not include `MERCY`: `Spare`. It is assumed unless otherwise stated.

## These Notes
- Written from the current [WR by Celestics](http://www.twitch.tv/celestics/v/19983842) as linked.

## Beginning

Name the Fallen Human a one character name.

## Ruins

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Froggit | `Compliment` | It is faster to hit the frog than wait for it to leap.
Whimsun | `Terrorize` |
Moldsmal | `Flee` | *Isn't this an instant `SPARE`?*
Napstablook | `Cheer` | *Really not feelin up to it right now. Sorry.*
Vegetoid | `Flee` |

### Flowey
- It's faster to hit the bullets. Run into them into the upper right corner, then into the circle at the bottom left.

### Dummy
- `ACT`: `Talk`

You will need `7 GOLD` by the time you get to the Spider Bakesale to purchase a Spider Donut. Three battles should be fine before then.

Run from the Froggit in the Spike puzzle room.

The pie question does not matter. Just mash through it.

Pick up the `Faded Ribbon` in the last pitfall room.

In case you don't remember, the Perspective Rooms (in order):
- Top column
- Red switch
- Leftmost column

## Home
Toriel heals you immediately, so no need to `SAVE`.

Sleep immediately.

Pick up the `Butterscotch Pie`.

When mashing through Toriel's text, listen to the bit on snails first and select `How to exit the RUINS` on the final prompt.

Enemy | `ACT`
:---- | :----
Toriel | `Spare`

> Hit the hand attacks. These are the fast ones.

> Hang around the upper left corner for the other fire vortex attacks.

> Getting to `2 HP` will force Toriel to not attack you.

## Path to Snowdin

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes
:---- | :---- | :----
Snowdrake | `Flee` |
Doggo | `Stick` |
Married Dogs | `Stick` |
Greater Dog | `Stick` |

> The `Stick` will allow you to bypass all dog-type enemies after using it once and then `SPARE`ing them after.

`SAVE` here to heal to full.

Pick up the `Tough Glove` from the `Box` and equip it.

No need to check the crossword puzzle.

Hit the switch before the Married Dogs.

Hit the switch in the three with the large X/O puzzle.

Say that `No` and `Even less` to the questions in the Colored Block puzzle room.

## Showdin Town

Purchase the `Manly Bandanna (50 GOLD)` in the Shop. Don't equip it yet.

Take the Underground Tunnel to the other side of town.

### Papyrus
It is faster to let him capture you three times (by 45 seconds!).

Head back to his home to hang out with him.

Go straight to his room and talk with him.

Mash through the hangout.

Select his hat. Platonically.

## Waterfall

Enemy | `ACT` | Notes

Aaron | `Flee` | *Who wouldn't?*
Woshua | `Flee` |
Moldsmal | `Spare` |
Shyren | `Flee` |
Temmie | `fLE E!!` |

Pick up the `Old Tutu` in the room after Sans.

In the final lilypad room, drop them upwards using the downmost ledge.

### Undyne Spears 1
Dodge the spears???

No need for the umbrella. Just wastes time.

### Undyne Spears 2: The Reckoning
You can manipulate these spears by moving all the way up or all the way down in a sort of zig-zag pattern.

### Dummy!
- Mash `SPARE`.
- Hit him with as much cotton as possible. He can be three-cycled.
- Unlike the cotton, which is hit-based, the rockets are move-based.
- Hit the knife to get rid of it faster.

`SAVE` here to heal to full.

Purchase the `Cloudy Glasses`.

Memorize the pathing for the Mushroom Room and the Lantern Room.

Do not help Monster Kid from the bridge. It's faster. (Sorry!)

### Undyne
- Hit `Challenge` as it makes the spears go faster.
- `Flee` ASAP.
- During the final phase, you may want to use `Check` instead of `Challenge` so that you don't die like a bitch.
- During the final phase, you want to finish off at `1 HP` by getting hit by three arrows and a spear at the end. This makes MTT's quiz go faster.

Be sure to water your Undyne!
