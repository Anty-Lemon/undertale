###Grinding

In every relevant room in the game, entering a room causes a lower step count to the next encounter than going for a second encounter without exiting said room. As a result, it is faster to exit and reenter the room directly after each encounter. In areas where there are two rooms with encounters next to each other, it is often faster to alternate getting an encounter between two rooms to minimize the time spent in screen transitions.

It is always okay to spare or flee against common enemies, unless otherwise noted. It will not abort genocide, even if you are in the last encounter before "but nobody came."


###Burnt Pan vs. Empty Gun

Getting the Burnt Pan early is ideally the fastest, but it comes down to personal preference.

todo: Core comparison

The pan is usually thought of as the safer option, but objectively, it's very similar in difficulty to the gun. The timing for a gold line is always frame perfect, excluding the last line for the pan, which has a 2-frame window. Though the gun's speed can be intimidating, it also makes it easier to tell what the time difference between two lines is at a glance. It's also worth noting that the Cowboy Hat gives you an extra 12 defense, which goes a long way for survivability, even if it is only used against Asgore.

In my opinion, choose whichever weapon you are better at and stick to it. While trying early pan and getting the gun as a backup strat sounds tempting, the difference between the two weapons can be jarring; it's enough to lose a few turns on Asgore.

##Ruins
####20 kills

Do not count Fake Froggit and Toriel

Monster | LOVE 1 | LOVE 2 | LOVE 3 | Notes
:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :----
Fake Froggit | `1-hit, center` | `N/A` | `N/A` | AKA first Froggit
Froggit | `N/A` | `2-hit, center + yellow` | `2-hit, center + mash`
Whimsun | `N/A` | `1-hit, mash` | `1-hit, mash` |
Moldsmal | `N/A` | `N/A` | `2-hit, center + yellow` | \**Sexy wiggle*\*

####Ruins Grind
- Kill Fake Froggit for LOVE 2
- Get an encounter at the end of the Leaf Pile SAVE room and the required fall room, then grind alternating between that room and the single rock room. Note that getting hit by Froggit's jump attack immediately ends Froggit's turn
- After 12 kills, get your 13th kill at the end of the single rock room, then grind in the three rock room. Froggits cannot use their jump attack when there is another monster in the battle, so in Froggit + Whimsun encounters, kill Whimsun first

By the time Flowey finishes saying "are you ready," be in the top-left corner to get hit by the nearest friendliness pellet. Then to the bottom-left for the circle

ACT -> Talk to the Dummy

Do not get the Butterscotch Pie

Mash kill Toriel

##Snowdin
####16 kills

Do not count Doggo, Dogamy, Dogaressa, Greater Dog, and Papyrus

Monster | LOVE 6 | LOVE 7/8 | Notes
:---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :----
Ice Cap | `1-hit, center` | `1-hit, center` | 
Snowdrake | `2-hit, center + yellow` | `2-hit, yellow + yellow` | 
Lesser Dog | `2-hit, ACT->Pet + mash` | `N/A` | Do not spare
Jerry | `Lots and lots and lots` | `of center attacks` | Spare, unless you need 1 more kill

####Snowdin Grind
- Get encounters at the end of the Box Road SAVE room, and on the small bridge before Dogamy and Dogaressa
- Do not walk on the ice in the ice room to get a Lesser Dog encounter at no time cost
- After the Papyrus cutscene on death bridge, go into Snowdin, then back out immediately to grind

Get the Tough Glove out of the box, and equip it. Besides having more ATK, the Tough Glove's attack animation is faster than the Stick's by ~0.3 seconds

Run straight into Doggo's attack so it ends faster. Or, if you don't want to get hit, stop just before the attack hits you for a negligible time loss

Kill Dogaressa first to 1-hit Dogamy

On Greater Dog's bark attack, getting hit by the dog ends the turn immediately

Mash kill Papyrus

Waterfall: 18 kills
Count Shyren and Glad Dummy

Don't get the Dusty Tutu; the Cloudy Glasses are a much better safety armor

Dodge Undyne's thrown spears
- On straight paths the spears can be dodged by staying to the bottom, then moving up once Undyne throws her spears
- Otherwise, it just takes practice to figure out where you can keep going and where you have to stop momentarily

Get and equip the Ballet Shoes
- In the second room after the crystal SAVE, take the first left, then get an encounter before entering the shoes room

OPTIONAL: If you encounter a 2 Moldsmal, spare the second, or if you encounter Aaron + Woshua, flee from Aaron
- This is a risky strat saving ~4-10 seconds (4 if 2 Moldsmal, 10 if Aaron + Woshua) which has a 53.8% chance of succeeding. It decreases the amount of steps you need for every encounter later on, but if you encounter a second Temmie, it forces you to take an extra encounter

Kill Shyren

Dodge Undyne's floor spears
- Follow [this path](https://i.imgur.com/2tCriVW.png)
- Same as the other spears, practice to figure it out

Mash kill Glad Dummy

OPTIONAL: Buy the Cloudy Glasses
- This makes Undying a lot safer, but decreases your 1st turn flee rate from 100% to 50% due to unequipping the Bandage. Fleeing usually doesn't matter in genocide, but if you keep the Bandage it allows you to use a risky strat in the Core

Get a 2nd encounter in the first room after Gerson

Grind between the hallway and the mush-room until 3/4

Go to Undying
- If a Temmie screws you over, grind at the end of the lantern room

Kill Undyne the Undying
- This fight just takes practice. Once you have her patterns down you probably won't die to her, but nonetheless she is the hardest fight to survive in genocide speedruns

Hotland: N/A

If you get the Burnt Pan, practice [early pan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipdEo5kY3kI)
- Walk up to the side of the dog food
- Hold left+right, hold up to bounce off the wall, then interact with the dog food after a moment
- Skip through Mettaton's dialogue until you automatically step forward
-- If desired, you can walk a few tiles forward while mashing through the dialogue. This saves about a second, but if you don't get to the fridge in time, you fail the glitch
- Interact with the fridge, and continue the dialogue up to the choice to get the noodles
- Hover over "Leave it"
- Mash through when Mettaton's dialogue overlaps the existing textbox
- Optionally, open the menu and attempt to equip the pan before the cutscene completely ends
-- You have to be quick with it, since when the camera locks back into place movement is enabled again, and the menu stops working

Kill Vulkin and Tsundereplane along the way

If you failed early pan, don't forget to get the pan. It's in the room right and down of the room you encounter Tsundereplane in

Walk to the elevator, go to L3

Kill the Royal Guards, kill Muffet

If you don't have the pan, get the Empty Gun and Cowboy Hat at Catty and Bratty's shop, to the right of the hotel entrance

Take the Core elevator

Go to the bridge directly to the left, grind there until 7 kills left

Kill everyone on the Path of the Warrior (rigged encounter room)

Mash kill Mettaton

Endgame:

The order you get the New Home keys in doesn't matter

If you are playing without the Steam API, save before sans and reset once he starts saying "So you finally made it."
- When you get back, you can mash through all the dialogue instead of just the second half

Sans
- todo
