# Pokemon Crystal (Any%, Glitchless)

## Route Rules
- Timing is by the in-game timer, as it shows either on the trainer card or on the save screen after beating Red and going through the second set of credits.
- Runs must be done in single-segment as otherwise the in-game timer is inaccurate, reloading to go to Kanto after Lance is allowed.
- Runs must be done on the English version.
- Using Pok√©doll to escape the shiny Gyarados is allowed.

## Beginning
- Set options:

```
  TEXT SPEED: FAST
BATTLE SCENE: OFF
BATTLE STYLE: SET
```

- Set time to **5:50 PM**.

## New Bark Town
- Set the day to **Sunday**.
- Say **no** to **Daylight Savings Time**.
- Head to the Lab.

## Professor Elm's Lab
- Pick up **Totodile**.
- You want a Totodile with `ATK 12`, `SP.DEF 11`, and `SPD 10`. 
- `SPD 9` is runnable, but might be slower.
- Totodile has a gender ratio of 87.5% male to 12.5% female. This means that if you see a female Totodile when you are setting a nickname, immediately reset, as it will have a maximum `ATK DV` of `1`.
