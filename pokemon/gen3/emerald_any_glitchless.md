## Route Rules
- Timing is by the in-game timer, as it shows on the back of the trainer card after reloading the file.
- Runs must be single segment (no save+quit), as otherwise the in-game timer is not accurate.
- Runs must be done on English version.
- Using glitches is not allowed.

## These Notes
Copied from the guide [here](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald_Mudkip/Rayquaza_Route) and personally modified.

### VBA-M
The message "The internal battery has died. The game can be played. However clock based events will no longer occur." may appear when you load the game. It is actually advantageous to have this message, as it eliminates random phone calls from registered trainers. Old carts will likely have this warning, and the emulator vba naturally has this warning. However, vba-m does not. To get the internal battery warning with vba-m, go to the folder you have vba-m saved in, and open the vba-over file in notepad. Find the line that reads "# Pokemon - Emerald Version (USA, Europe)", and in the lines below, edit "rtcEnabled=1" to "rtcEnabled=0".

## Notation
- Whenever the route refers to Mudkip's stats, it will be in the form `xx/xx/xx`, where the "`x`"s represent numbers. In order, these refer to the stats `Attack`, `Special Attack` and `Speed`.
- If the route says to avoid a trainer, and the trainer's name is **bold**, that trainer is a spinner. "Timed" spinners/Rotatos (i.e. trainers that spin in a predictable fashion, non-randomly) will not be in bold.
- If "@[Item Name]" follows after a pokemon, it means it is holding an item that you should be aware of. Not all of the items that each pokemon are holding are written here, just the ones that are significant to the route.
- Unless stated otherwise (normally by "use this move until it faints"), battles are detailed turn by turn.

## New Game
Before starting a new game, set your options as:

  - Text Speed - Fast
  - Battle Scene - Off
  - Battle Style - Set

Other options can be set as you please.

Start a new game, and choose Girl (the Brendan 2 fight is much safer as the girl), and name your character a single character name.

## Littleroot Town
Leave the clock at default.

Collect the Potion from your PC.

Once the conversations with Mom are done, head towards Brendan's house. Enter, talk to Brendan's mom, and head upstairs. As soon as you enter the room, leave again and go to walk out the house. Brendan will appear and talk to you.

Head out and north to Route 101 to meet Prof. Birch.

## Route 101
Choose Mudkip after looking in the bag, and then the Zigzagoon fight will begin.

In the battle, check Mudkip's nature and stats. The minimum stats that are runnable are `13/10/9`.

> It is recommended to only accept `13/11/9`, however `10 Sp.Atk` can be run with, but with some time loss (mostly to the 3 double battles in the Magma and Aqua hideouts). `14/10/9+` is also acceptable, as the time gained from `14 Attack` negates the time lost from `10 Sp.Attack`.

Note: Defenses and Hp don't matter in terms of resetting, however higher is better. The best possible Mudkip for a run is Naughty natured, 14/11/10. The possible stat values at Lvl.5 are:

Stat | HP | Attack | Defense | Sp.Atk | Sp.Def | Speed
:----|:--:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:----:
Min (-nature) | -- | 10 |  9 |  9 |  9 |  8
Min           | 20 | 12 | 10 | **10** | 10 |  **9**
Max           | 21 | **13** | 11 | **11** | 11 | **10**
Max (+nature) | -- | **14** | 12 | **12** | 12 | **11**

> Note: -nature and +nature mean a decreasing and increasing nature in that stat, respectively.

### Wild Encounter
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
Zigzagoon | Tackle until it faints.

## Littleroot Town
In the conversation with Prof. Birch, nickname your Mudkip a one character name.

Say "Yes" to seeing Brendan, and exit the lab.

From here, head north, through Route 101 and Oldale Town into Route 103. Run from any encounters.

## Route 103
Speak to Brendan to start the first Rival fight.

### Rival Brendan
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
Treecko | Tackle until it faints.

Beating Treecko will level Mudkip to lvl.6.

  - Check its Attack here, if it goes to `15` continue on, if not reset.
  - Also take note of Mudkip's health at the end of the fight, if it is lower than `4 HP` after the level up, you will need to Potion before the next fight.

After the Brendan fight return south to Prof. Birch's lab.
